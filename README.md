# Project Ideas 

**Deadline for project submissions is February 6 at 12:00 PST**

### TransmogrifAI [salesforce/transmogrifai](https://github.com/salesforce/TransmogrifAI)

### Design System React [salesforce/design-system-react](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react)
This project is open to original proposals from participants.

#### Proposal Suggestions
* **Re-architect and open-source project website.** Keeping documentation resources up-to-date and meeting developer needs can make or break a library's reputation. This task would allow the participant to showcase a deliverable that a developer manager would like to see and share their commitment to building a quality engineering culture at scale through quality documentation. It would focus on re-engineering and open-sourcing the documentation site (https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/) and increasing alignment with the Lightning Design System website. Technologies likely to be used include Redux, React, react-docgen, Express, Webpack, and more.

* **Create 3 or more Lightning Design System components.** Be a part of creating some of the worldâ€™s best enterprise app experiences by building user-centered, re-usable, presentational components. Creating an accessible UI can be a nascent skill even for front-end engineers that have been coding for years. This will expose the participant to program management, cross-company collaboration between user experience engineering and product engineering in an enterprise engineering organization. Components will be audited, reviewed, and added to the library and then be used by Salesforce products in production.

* **Iterate on developer experience:** Geared toward a participant interested in developer operations, this task would focus on iterating and streamlining the contributor workflow to ensure a convenient and clear developer experience that scales and increases developer productivity. Technologies likely to be used include Webpack, Babel, Storybook, Jest and Mocha suites, Visual Regression Tests, and aXe accessibility automated testing.


### oclif [oclif/oclif](https://github.com/oclif/oclif)
* **Design an oclif linter.** Linters have become the go-to way of enforcing code styles. For this project, we're looking to build a linter for oclif developers to enforce better practices. The linter needs to be able to lint both Typescript and plain JS CLI's, should run via the command line and also integrate into various IDE's (ex: Atom, VS Code).
